## Feature Groups

You can selectively run features based on groups. To group features together just place them in the same sub-folder. The folder name is the name of the group.
You can use Nightwatch CLI `--group`, `--skipgroup` flags. [More details ](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#test-groups)

```bash
npm run e2e-test -- --group google
```
