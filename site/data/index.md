# Introduction

## What is Nightwatch API?

Nightwatch API is JavaScript (Node.js) programming interface for controlling [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/) which is an End-to-End (E2E) testing solution for browser based apps and websites.
Nightwatch.js uses the powerful [W3C WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) API to perform commands and assertions on DOM elements. Nightwatch API adds a huge flexibility and control to Nightwatch.js. It enables using any type of test runner or browser control without using runner at all. Let's mention some use cases supported by this package.

- Running E2E tests using any test runner ([Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), [TAP](https://www.node-tap.org/), ...)
- Running acceptance tests based on feature requirements written in Gherkin language ([Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js))
- Controlling the browser using Nightwatch.js commands and assertions

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nightwatch-api
```

This library has a `peerDependencies` listing for `nightwatch` version above `1.0.0`.
It should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nightwatch@beta
```

You may also be interested in installing [chromedriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chromedriver) and [geckodriver][https://www.npmjs.com/package/geckodriver] (for Firefox) or [selenium-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-server), so anybody can easily run the library without the need to do any manual installation.

## Configuration

In project root create a JavaScript configuration file for Nightwatch.js. We suggest to use `nightwatch.conf.js` instead of `nightwatch.json` as it provides much more flexibility and ability to import packages in the configuration. For more details about the content of this file check out the [Nightwatch.js docs](http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted#settings-file). Unfortunately the docs are still for version `0.9.x`. In this example there are 3 nightwatch environments

- default - runs Chrome headless
- chrome - runs Chrome with UI
- firefox - runs Firefox with UI

All of the environments are connecting directly to the Chromedriver or Geckodriver (in case of Firefox) without
using Selenium server.

You can view the complete list of capabilities on [SeleniumHQ wiki](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities).

```javascript
// nightwatch.conf.js

const chromedriver = require('chromedriver');
const geckodriver = require('geckodriver');

module.exports = {
  test_settings: {
    default: {
      webdriver: {
        start_process: true,
        server_path: chromedriver.path,
        cli_args: ['--port=4444']
      },
      desiredCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'chrome',
        javascriptEnabled: true,
        acceptSslCerts: true,
        chromeOptions: {
          args: ['headless', 'disable-gpu']
        }
      }
    },
    chrome: {
      webdriver: {
        server_path: chromedriver.path
      },
      desiredCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'chrome',
        javascriptEnabled: true,
        acceptSslCerts: true,
        chromeOptions: {
          args: ['disable-gpu']
        }
      }
    },
    firefox: {
      webdriver: {
        server_path: geckodriver.path
      },
      desiredCapabilities: {
        browserName: 'firefox',
        marionette: true
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## Usage

Let's create a file called `test.js` to try out the features

```javascript
// test.js

const {
  createSession,
  closeSession,
  startWebDriver,
  stopWebDriver,
  client
} = require('nightwatch-api');

async function setup(env = 'default') {
  await startWebDriver(env);
  await createSession(env);
}

async function shutdown() {
  await closeSession();
  await stopWebDriver();
}

async function run() {
  await client.url('https://duckduckgo.com/');
  let title;
  await client.getTitle(t => (title = t));
  console.log(title);
}

(async function() {
  try {
    await setup('chrome');
    await run();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err.stack);
  } finally {
    await shutdown();
  }
})();
```

## Execution

You can run the example using

```bash
node test.js
```

Now try to change the `environment` parameter of the `setup` function. In this example the supported environments are `default`, `chrome` and `firefox`. You can change the code to get the environment from command line arguments as well.

For complete working examples check out the [examples](https://github.com/mucsi96/nightwatch-api/tree/master/examples) folder of the source.
